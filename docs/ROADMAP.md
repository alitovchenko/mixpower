# Roadmap

## Near term

- Add mixed-effects model fitting via `lme4` with convergence diagnostics.
- Expand simulation engine to support repeated measures designs.
- Add detailed power uncertainty reporting and visualizations.

## Mid term

- Support non-Gaussian outcomes (binary, count).
- Add parallel backends and progress reporting.
- Publish full reproducibility vignette with end-to-end examples.

## Long term

- Provide a GUI for interactive study design exploration.
- Expand to hierarchical power analyses with Bayesian alternatives.
